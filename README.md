# COMP4418 Knowledge Representation (2024, T3)
This repository contains my coursework for the COMP4418 Knowledge Representation course, offered as part of my studies at UNSW. The course provides an in-depth exploration of the principles and techniques used in representing knowledge in artificial intelligence systems, with a focus on logical formalisms, ontologies, reasoning, and automated decision-making.

In this course, we covered topics such as:

Logical representation of knowledge
Semantic networks and ontologies
First-order logic
Inference methods and reasoning techniques
Knowledge representation in AI systems
Assignment Scores
Assignment 1: 90/100
Assignment 2: 99/100
Assignment 3: 100/100
Each assignment involved applying theoretical concepts in practical scenarios, with a focus on designing, analyzing, and implementing knowledge representation systems.
